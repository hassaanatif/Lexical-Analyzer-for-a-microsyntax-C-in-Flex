# Lexical-Analyzer-for-a-microsyntax-C-in-Flex
This was a small semester project that I did for my Compiler Construction course.   
With the help of the flex tool, I was able to construct my own sort of a "micro C" syntax and then with the help of this tool and some trivial C/C++ code at the backend, this program is able to tokenize all the "lexemes" that the user types on the console. This program also features some macros that allow you to: 
- See all the tokens recognized so far 
- Clear the console window 
- Exit the program 

Due to the very little resources available on the Flex program, this program was largely done by following the "learning by doing" rule, so I might not be using the typical conventions that go along while writing such programs in Flex. 

Following were the resources that helped me: 
i) Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools by Alfred V. Aho, et al.
ii) Engineering a Compiler by Keith D. Cooper and Linda Torczon
iii) The official Flex repository on github (https://github.com/westes/flex)
